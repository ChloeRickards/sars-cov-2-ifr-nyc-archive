This is the code associated with the preprint for Rickards & Kilpatrick 2020. The updated version can be found at ChloeRickards/sars-cov-2-ifr-nyc

If you wish to replcate the results, run the files in the following order:
1. draw_ifrs.R
- This creates the seroprevalence draws and runs the statistical test that generates the IFTs
2. postprocess.R
- This processes the IFR draws into results, and provides graphs of the delay distributions, epidata, and timeline. You need to run "draw_ifrs.R" before you run this one.
3. additional_postprocess.R
- This compares multiple runs of the processed IFR code. You need to run "draw_ifrs.R" AND "postprocess.R" for adjusted and raw before you run this one.

Other files in here include:

- Data files
	- daily_cases_trunc.csv
	- daily_deaths_trunc.csv
	- IFR_comparison.csv
	- NYC_pop_age_total.csv
	- NYCHealth_cumul_data.csv
	- serop_age_spain.csv
	- Seroprev_by_age.csv
	- serosurvey_by_age_draws.csv

- Function files
	- ifr_betabinomial.stan
	- stanfit_file
	- utils.R


You may see more files appear in your folder. These contain data objects or figures that are generated in the code. These files include:

- age_stratified_IFRs_"suffix".rds - this contains all of the IFRs estimations, not yet processed, after it's gone through the stan model
- data_setup.rda - this carries data over from "draw_ifrs" to "postprocess"
- delay_dist.png - graph of delay distributions, generated in "postprocess"
- epidata.png - graph of cases and deaths, generated in "postprocess"
- ifr_comparison.png - graph of IFRs compared against each other, generated in "additional_postprocess"
- ifr_posteriors_"suffix" - histogram of IFR posterior draws
- IFR_stats_"suffix".rds - this contains the processed IFR data, ready to be compared against multiple runs in "additional_postprocess"
- IFRs_pvals_"suffix".tex - LaTeX output of processed IFRs
- nyc_timeline.png - epidata graphed against the timeline of the serosurvey and proposed infection times
- seroprevalence_"suffix".tex - contains data of seroprevalences after they've been manipulated in "draws_ifrs", ready to be passed to "additional_postprocess"


If you are running this code in RStudio, you may come across an error somewhere along the lines of "unknown or uninitialised column: 'var' . This is a glitch in RStudio and tibble, and doesn't require any action. For more information, see this Stack Overflow thread:
